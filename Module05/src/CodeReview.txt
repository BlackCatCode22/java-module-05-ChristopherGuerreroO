Code Review

I reviewed the loadAnimals() method because it was a central part of our program and had a few issues that needed improvement.

Changes Made:
- Fixed constructor argument mismatches for Animal subclasses (Hyena, Lion, Tiger, Bear)
- Improved the error handling when files were not found
- Used better naming for variables like 'parts' to make the code clearer
- Made sure to use File.separator for cross-platform compatibility

Reason for Changes:
These improvements made the method more reliable, readable, and aligned with OOP practices.

Before:
Hyena hyena = new Hyena(name, age, type);

After:
Hyena hyena = new Hyena(name, age, isAlpha);
