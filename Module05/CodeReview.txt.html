<pre><span class="s0">Code Review</span>

<span class="s0">I reviewed the loadAnimals() method because it was a central part of our program and had a few issues that needed improvement.</span>

<span class="s0">Changes Made:</span>
<span class="s0">- Fixed constructor argument mismatches for Animal subclasses (Hyena, Lion, Tiger, Bear)</span>
<span class="s0">- Improved the error handling when files were not found</span>
<span class="s0">- Used better naming for variables like 'parts' to make the code clearer</span>
<span class="s0">- Made sure to use File.separator for cross-platform compatibility</span>

<span class="s0">Reason for Changes:</span>
<span class="s0">These improvements made the method more reliable, readable, and aligned with OOP practices.</span>

<span class="s0">Before:</span>
<span class="s0">Hyena hyena = new Hyena(name, age, type);</span>

<span class="s0">After:</span>
<span class="s0">Hyena hyena = new Hyena(name, age, isAlpha);</span>
